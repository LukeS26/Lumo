The Speaker Recognition Riles on a different open source project called Deep-speaker. The code is able
to recognize voices and differietante between them. your conversation will be associated with your
voice.

To create a voice run the store_voice.py. Type in your name. When the program outputs "Recording..."
speak to record your voice. It's prefered to record your voice in a room without any outside noise.
The longer you speak the more accurate it will be, but the longer the program will have to run.

You can edit the distance min in config.py. Higher values let the program discard more false positives
but discard true positves as well. Lower values let the program keep more true positves, but keep more
false postives.

To Future Lumo Developers the Diarization code is commeted and still available so if you wish to fix
or implement speaker diarization you may use that. The code was written with pyannote in mind with a
previous version of forge so you will have to get around that.
